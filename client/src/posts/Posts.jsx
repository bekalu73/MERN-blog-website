            Apple just dropped an invite for its next event. Scheduled for May
            7, the “Let Loose” presentation appears to be happening exclusively
            online — something that became standard fare for the company during
            the pandemic. Over the last couple of years, however, Apple has
            returned to in-person events, including WWDC, which kicks off in
            Cupertino on June 10.
